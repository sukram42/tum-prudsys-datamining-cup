# TUM's participation at the Prudsys Datamining Cup 2020
This repository contains the code base of contribution of the Technical University of Munich (TUM) for the Datamining cup of Prudsys in the year 2020.

## Information
More information on the competition can be found on the [Prudsys website](https://www.data-mining-cup.com/dmc-2020/). In the end we were able to reach the **13th place** in the internation competition.


In this repository we added the [documentation paper](Prudsys_Data_Mining_Cup_Report.pdf).

To structure the workload of our contribution, we were creating a pipeline for the preprocessing, training and the prediction of the data. The steps of the pipeline are marked with roman numbers as prefixes.
